           "username"

           "useragent"
               OPTIONAL: Sets the User Agent header in the HTTP request. If omitted, this will default to

       set_auth($username, $password
           Change the username/password for logging into fonolo.com. This is helpful when managing multiple accounts.

           $username is the fonolo.com username (e-mail address) of the client account.

           $password is the plain-text password or the client account.

       SYSTEM FUNCTIONS

       get_version

       check_member
           Validates the current username/password, set by the new or set_auth methods.

       check_member_number($phone_number)
           Validates that the given phone number belongs to the current username/password, and that it’s active. "Deep
           Dial" requests can only be made to numbers that are currently configured on the given fonolo.com account.

           $phone_number is the phone number to validated, formatted as XXX-YYY-ZZZZ. This value can also be a SIP
           address in the format: sip:XXX@YYY

       COMPANY FUNCTIONS

       company_search($search_string)
           Perform a search against the fonolo.com database for the given search string.

           XXX-YYY-ZZZZ.

       company_list
